### imports

jquery
bootstrap (i realized its ugly and not what everyone is making it out to be)
webamp (thanks to [Webamp](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp/) by [captbaritone](https://github.com/captbaritone)!)

### notes

github pages does not allow for dynamic sites or run server-side js. a lot of jekyll and html is being used to organize the code, but the end result is still all the clientside js being run on one page

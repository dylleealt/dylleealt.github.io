    <p>is a hotdog a sandwich</p>
    <p>
        no, the definition of a sandwich is arbitrary and descriptive, not based
        on its shape language or some consistent set of rules. a sub is a
        sandwich, a roll is a sandwich. but just because something has bread or
        a bun or any other ingredients does not make it a sandwich, the way
        french toast with berry compote is not a jam sandwich. you may think
        anything that has two components on the top and bottom qualifies as a
        sandwich (even though a hot dog barely satisfies these conditions), for
        example a donut sandwich, a croissant sandwich, an ice cream sandwich,
        but you would be wrong. the reality of language is, if you call a hot
        dog a sausage sandwich no one knows what you're talking about. but you
        can slap someone across the face with a slice of bread and call them an
        idiot sandwich and the only confusion you'll see in their face is why
        the fuck you did that.
